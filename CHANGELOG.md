## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-29
### Fixed
- Daemon now starts on hosts with a long `$HOME`. The RPC socket moved from `state_dir/rpc.sock` to a short per-user runtime dir (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, else `/tmp/cao-<uid>`) as `cao-<hash16>.sock`, avoiding the AF_UNIX `sun_path` limit (108 Linux / 104 macOS) that made `bind()` fail (#3, #5). `state_dir` and all persistent data (`--resume` trajectories, events, digests, `shadow.git`, `root` marker) are unchanged.
- Daemon startup errors are no longer swallowed: the companion routes the daemon subprocess stderr to `<state_dir>/daemon-boot.log`, and the "did not become ready" message points at it.
### Changed
- Pin `ruff`/`mypy` dev tools (`ruff>=0.15,<0.16`, `mypy>=2.1,<2.2`) so unpinned "latest" lint/type-rule drift no longer breaks CI.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-23
### Added
- `gemini-3.6-flash` and `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` added to the supported-model allowlist (region `global`); recovery message + README + `/agy:setup` docs updated.
### Changed
- Default model is now `gemini-3.6-flash` (was `gemini-3.5-flash`).
### Fixed
- Support `google-antigravity` 0.1.7: its new `conversation_id` >= 32-char validator broke the resume tests; migrated the fixtures and raised the SDK cap to `<0.2`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-12
### Fixed
- Companion now receives the plugin data dir via a `--plugin-data` argument (from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`) instead of relying on the `$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` bridge, which Claude Code does not reliably propagate to slash-command Bash env (notably under `--resume`). Fixes "backend not installed" when the backend actually is installed.
- Backend now resolves the GCP project for Vertex mode from ADC `quota_project_id` / gcloud config (not just `google.auth.default()`, which returns `None` for authorized-user ADC), and raises a clear error instead of crashing when no project can be resolved.
- Worker crashes now surface a `session.ended` event with the reason and are written to `<state_dir>/daemon.log` (previously the traceback was lost to `DEVNULL`).
- `/agy:setup` can capture the GCP project for Vertex mode.
- Backend-absent tests isolated with `python -S` so CI (system-installed package) reflects real absence.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-12
### Fixed
- Accurate "restart Claude Code" message when the Python backend is missing after a mid-session `/plugin install` (SessionStart does not fire mid-session); guards added in both the setup and daemon command paths. SessionEnd stays silent.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-11
### Added
- Initial public release
